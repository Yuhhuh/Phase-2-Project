# Phase 2 Project:

This Project is a Gallery for any screenshots I take in the games I play.

# Goals
- Have a Functioning gallery home page.
- Allow the user to click on an image and have it link to a Larger Display.
- Have a larger display page containing the image, a title, an author, and a description of the image.
- Have a retractable side bar.
- Allow the user to edit the larger Image page and charge the descrition, the author, or the title.
- Have the edit link to a seperate page to change the properties.
- Have a link that goes back to the main image page to show the updates.

# Images
- All images were taken and provided by myself.
