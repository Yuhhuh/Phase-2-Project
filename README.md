# Phase 2 Project:

This Project is a Gallery for any screenshots I take in the games I play.

To Run this project you will have to run the following in your terminal;
- json-server --watch db.json
Then
- npm run start, if it asks to run on localhost:3001 choose yes

# Goals
- Have a Functioning gallery home page.
- Allow the user to click on an image and have it link to a Larger Display.
- Have a larger display page containing the image, a title, an author, and a description of the image.
- Have a retractable side bar.
- Allow the user to edit the larger Image page and charge the descrition, the author, or the title.
- Have the edit link to a seperate page to change the properties.
- Have a link that goes back to the main image page to show the updates.

# Images
- All images were taken and provided by myself.
- Some of the buildings within the images were built by my friends, however they have requested to remain anonymous
